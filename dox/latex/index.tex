The srs\+RAN Project is a complete 5G RAN solution, featuring an ORAN-\/native CU/\+DU developed by \href{https://www.srs.io/}{\texttt{ SRS}}.

The solution includes a complete L1/2/3 implementation with minimal external dependencies. Portable across processor architectures, the software has been optimized for x86 and ARM. srs\+RAN follows the 3GPP 5G system architecture implementing the functional splits between distributed unit (DU) and centralized unit (CU). The CU is further disaggregated into control plane (CU-\/\+CP) and user-\/plane (CU-\/\+UP).
